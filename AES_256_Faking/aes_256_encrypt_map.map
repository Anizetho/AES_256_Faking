ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,964 out of  93,296    3%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               2,964
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,304 out of  46,648    4%
    Number used as logic:                    2,304 out of  46,648    4%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,990
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                  314
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  11,072    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  23,324    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,353
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,507 out of   4,353   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:               2,049 out of   4,353   47%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         797 out of   4,353   18%
    Number of unique control sets:              18
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              28 out of  93,296    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
